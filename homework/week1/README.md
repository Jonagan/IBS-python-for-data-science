# Homework week 1

`student_1_2_1.ipynb` contains boilerplate code to load the `pokemon.csv` file correctly.

Questions about this week's homework can be posted in the slack channel #python-for-data-science or by contacting one of the teachers directly.

Homework is due Monday August 3rd 12:00 CEST.

Hand in homework by sending it to Sijmen van der Willik on slack.

Good luck!
