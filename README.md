# Isatis Business Solutions Summer School: Python for Data Science

This repository contains the homework and other course material for each of the lessons during the summer school.

Homework is due the Monday before the next lesson at 12:00 and should be handed in by sending it directly to one of the teachers using the IBS Academy slack channel.

## Installation

For beginners we recommend to use both:

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/)
- [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

Follow the steps for Anaconda Navigator under [installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/). You can then install JupyterLab using the Anaconda navigator UI.

If you're running into trouble, let us know in the Slack channel!

If you're familiar with the command line, feel free to use `conda`:

- [Conda Commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html)
